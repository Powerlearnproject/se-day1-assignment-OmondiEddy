#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. This subject is important in the technology industry since it ensures that software products are built to meet user needs, are scalable, maintainable, and reliable. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Inception of Structured Programming (1960s): Structured programming introduced concepts such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines, which made programs more understandable and maintainable. 

2. The Waterfall Model (1970s): The introduction of the Waterfall model formalized the software development process into distinct phasesâ€”requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 

3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s): Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, shifted the focus from a rigid, linear process to a more iterative and flexible approach. Agile promotes continuous feedback, collaboration, and adaptability, making it particularly effective in environments where requirements are constantly evolving.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)	Requirements Gathering and Analysis: Understanding what the users need and documenting the requirements.
b)	System Design: Creating the architecture of the software system, including data models, interfaces, and algorithms.
c)	Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design documents.
d)	Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended, identifying and fixing bugs.
e)	Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
f)	Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software after release to ensure it continues to work well.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i.	Waterfall Methodology: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change. Example: Developing software for regulated industries like healthcare or aerospace, where thorough documentation and adherence to strict guidelines are crucial.

ii.	Agile Methodology: An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of small, functional increments of the product. Suitable for projects where requirements are expected to evolve. Example: Developing a new web application where user feedback will significantly influence the design and features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a)	Software Developer: Responsible for writing code, implementing features, and debugging software. They translate design documents into functional software components.
b)	Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Focuses on testing the software to identify defects and ensure that it meets the required standards. They design test cases, execute tests, and document issues.
c)	Project Manager: Oversees the software development project, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the specified requirements. They coordinate between different teams, manage resources, and track project progress.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. They often include features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrated testing tools, which streamline the development process. Examples include Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.

Version Control Systems (VCS): VCS tools like Git and Subversion (SVN) allow developers to track changes to code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of the software. VCS is crucial for maintaining code integrity, especially in teams where multiple developers work on the same project.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i.	Managing Complexity: Large software projects can become extremely complex, making them difficult to understand and maintain. 
Strategy: Break down the project into smaller, manageable modules and use clear documentation.

ii.	Changing Requirements: Requirements can evolve over time, leading to scope creep. 
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to accommodate changes through iterative development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i.	Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules to ensure they work correctly. It helps catch bugs early in the development process.
ii.	Integration Testing: Testing how different modules or components work together. It ensures that the integrated system functions as expected.
iii.	System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
iv.	Acceptance Testing: Conducted by the end-users or clients to ensure the software meets their needs and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models like GPT-4 to generate desired outputs. It's crucial for optimizing the interaction with AI, ensuring the responses are accurate, relevant, and aligned with the user's intentions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about a phone?
Improved Prompt: Discuss the importance of a phone in communication and explain the different kind of phones available in the market today.
The improved prompt is specific, clear, and targeted, which helps the AI generate a focused and relevant response.
